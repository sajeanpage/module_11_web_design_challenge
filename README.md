## Summary

- I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with the trip planning, I decided to do a climate analysis about the area.  What I found is that it rains pretty frequently in Hawaii with average rainfall approaching 1 inch per day and, on most days the temperature is between 73 and 78F.  In the process of my analysis I created a handy app to evaluate the weather.
